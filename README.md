## Dependencies

When you clone the project, create a `Deps` folder in the project folder and download the following dependencies inside:

- [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog)
- [entt](https://github.com/skypjack/entt/tree/master/src/entt)
- [sdl2](https://www.libsdl.org/)

The dependencies should be accessable through the following paths:

```bash
 $(ProjectPath)\Deps\spdlog\{include,src}
 $(ProjectPath)\Deps\entt\{src}
 $(ProjectPath)\Deps\sdl2\{include,lib} 
```
